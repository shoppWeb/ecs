# CreateSnapshot

You can call this operation to create a snapshot for a disk.

## Description

In the following scenarios, you cannot create snapshots for a disk:

-   The number of manual snapshots \(also called user-created snapshots\) of the disk has reached 256.
-   A snapshot is being created for the disk.
-   The instance to which the disk is attached has never been started.
-   The instance to which the disk is attached is not in the **Stopped** \(`Stopped`\) or **Running** \(`Running`\) state.
-   If the response contains `{"OperationLocks": {"LockReason" : "security"}}` when you query information of an instance, the instance is locked for security reasons and all operations are prohibited on the instance.

When you create a snapshot, take note of the following items:

-   About one hour after an instance is created or the system disk of an instance is replaced, you can create a snapshot for a disk that is attached to the instance. After a data disk is added, you must wait a period of time before you can create a snapshot. The amount of time to wait depends on the size of data stored on the disk.
-   If a snapshot is being created, you cannot call the [CreateImage](~~25535~~) operation to create a custom image from this snapshot.
-   If the disk for which you want to create a snapshot is attached to an ECS instance, do not change the instance status during snapshot creation.
-   You can create snapshots for a disk that is in the **Expired** \(`Expired`\) state. If the release time scheduled for a disk in the Expired state arrives when a snapshot is being created for the disk, the snapshot is in the **Creating** \(`Creating`\) state and is deleted when the disk is released.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=CreateSnapshot&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)

|DiskId|String|Yes|d-bp1s5fnvk4gn2tws0\*\*\*\*|The ID of the disk for which to create the snapshot. |
|SnapshotName|String|No|testSnapshotName|The name of the snapshot. The name must be 2 to 128 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, colons \(:\), underscores \(\_\), and hyphens \(-\). It must start with a letter and cannot start with http:// or https://.

It cannot start with auto because snapshots whose names start with auto are recognized as automatic snapshots. |

This parameter is empty by default. |
|RetentionDays|Integer|No|30|The retention period of the snapshot. Valid values: 1 to 65536. Unit: days. The snapshot will be automatically released when the retention period expires.

This parameter is empty by default, indicating that the snapshot will not be automatically released. |
|Category|String|No|Standard|The type of the snapshot. Valid values:

-   Standard: normal snapshot
-   Flash: local snapshot

**Note:** This parameter will be removed in the future. We recommend that you use other parameters to ensure future compatibility. |
|ClientToken|String|No|123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000|The client token that is used to ensure the idempotence of the request. You can use the client to generate the value, but you must ensure that it is unique among different requests. The **ClientToken** value can only contain ASCII characters and cannot exceed 64 characters in length. For more information, see [How to ensure idempotence](~~25693~~). |
|Tag.N.value|String|No|null|The value of tag N to be bound to the snapshot.

**Note:** This parameter will be removed in the future. We recommend that you use the Tag.N.Value parameter to ensure future compatibility. |
|Tag.N.key|String|No|null|The key of tag N to be bound to the snapshot.

**Note:** This parameter will be removed in the future. We recommend that you use the Tag.N.Key parameter to ensure future compatibility. |
|Tag.N.Key|String|No|TestKey|The key of tag N to be bound to the snapshot. Valid values of N: 1 to 20. The tag key cannot be an empty string. It can be up to 128 characters in length and cannot start with acs: or aliyun. It cannot contain http:// or https://. |
|Tag.N.Value|String|No|TestValue|The value of tag N to be bound to the snapshot. Valid values of N: 1 to 20. The tag value can be an empty string. It can be up to 128 characters in length and cannot start with acs: or contain http:// or https://. |
|ResourceGroupId|String|No|rg-bp67acfmxazb4p\*\*\*\*|The ID of the resource group to which to assign the snapshot. |

## Response parameters
