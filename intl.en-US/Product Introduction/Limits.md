# Limits

This topic describes the limits on ECS and how to apply for extensions on some limits.

## Overview

ECS has the following limits:

-   You cannot install virtualization software such as VMware Workstation or use ECS instances for secondary virtualization. Only ECS bare metal instances and Super Computing Clusters \(SCCs\) support secondary virtualization.
-   ECS does not support sound card applications.
-   External hardware devices such as hardware dongles, USB flash drives, external hard disks, and hardware tokens, cannot be directly attached to ECS instances. Software verification methods such as two-factor authentication and dynamic passwords can be used.
-   ECS does not support multicast protocols. We recommend that you use unicast protocols instead.
-   Log Service does not support 32-bit Linux ECS instances.

    For information about the ECS instances that support Log Service, see [Logtail overview](/intl.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Overview/Logtail overview.md).

-   To apply for ICP filings for websites that are deployed on your ECS instance, ensure that the instance meets ICP filing requirements. You can apply for a limited number of ICP filing service numbers for each ECS instance. For more information, see [Prepare and check the instance and access information](). For information about how to apply for ICP filings, see [ICP filing application overview]().

## View quotas

You can click **Privileges** on the **Overview** page of the ECS console, and select a region to view the resource usage and quotas in that region. If the quota for a resource type is insufficient, submit a ticket to request a quota increase. For more information about how to view privileges and quotas, see [View and increase quotas \(new version\)](/intl.en-US/Tag & Resource/Resource/View and increase quotas (new version).md) or [DescribeAccountAttributes](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Others/DescribeAccountAttributes.md).

|:---|:----|:-----------------------------------------|
|Peak inbound bandwidth|-   If the purchased peak outbound bandwidth is less than or equal to 10 Mbit/s, Alibaba Cloud allocates an inbound bandwidth of 10 Mbit/s.

## Security group limits

|Item|Basic security group|Advanced security group|
|----|--------------------|-----------------------|
|Quota for security groups that can be created per region in an account|100 \(1\)|Same as the limit on basic security groups.|
|Quota for classic network-type ECS instances that can be contained in a classic network-type security group|1,000 \(2\)|The classic network is not supported.|
|Quota for VPC-type ECS instances that can be contained in a VPC-type security group|Depends on the number of private IP addresses that can be contained in the VPC-type security group.|No limits.|
|Quota for security groups to which an ECS instance can belong|5 You can submit a ticket to raise the limit to 10 or 16 security groups.

|Same as the limit on basic security groups.|
|Quota for security groups to which an ENI of an ECS instance can belong|
|Quota for rules \(including inbound and outbound rules\) in a security group|200 \(3\)|Same as the limit on basic security groups.|
|Quota for rules \(including inbound and outbound rules\) in all security groups to which an ENI belongs|1,000|Same as the limit on basic security groups.|
|Quota for private IP addresses that can be contained in a VPC-type security group|2,000 \(4\)|65,536.|
|Internet access port|The default SMTP port for outbound traffic is port 25, which is disabled by default. It cannot be enabled by security group rules.|Same as the limit on basic security groups.|

-   \(1\) The following regions share the quota for security groups that can be created in each account: China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shanghai\), China \(Qingdao\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Shenzhen\), China \(Hong Kong\), US \(Silicon Valley\), and Singapore \(Singapore\). A maximum of 100 security groups can be created in all of these regions in an account.
-   \(2\) If more than 1,000 classic network-type instances need mutual access over the internal network, you can assign them to multiple security groups and authorize mutual access among these security groups.
-   \(3\) If you increase the quota for security groups to which an ECS instance can belong, the quota for rules in each security group decreases. The product of the quota for security groups to which an ECS instance belongs and the quota for rules in each security group cannot exceed 1,000. For example, if the quota for security groups to which the ECS instance can belong is 5, 10, or 16, the corresponding quota for rules in each security group is 200, 100, or 60, which are verified by using the following formulas: 5 × 200 = 1000, 10 × 100 = 1000, and 16 × 60 ≤ 1000.
-   \(4\) If more than 2,000 private IP addresses need mutual access over the internal network, you can distribute the ECS instances of these private IP addresses to multiple security groups and authorize mutual access among these security groups.

## Deployment set limits

|:---|:----|:-----------------------------------------|
|Quota for deployment sets per region in an account|2|Submit a ticket.|
